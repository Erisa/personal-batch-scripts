# Personal Batch Scripts
The contents of this repository are no longer needed and thus it has been archived. The scripts still remain for archival purposes, and should ideally not be used.

---

This repository contains my personal batch (`.bat`) scripts used to automate aspects of my Windows 10 usage.  
These scripts are highly personalized and are not recommended to be used as-is on other peoples computers. The scripts are made public in the hopes that someone can either adapt them for themselves or learn from them.  
Most Pull Requests and Issues will not be considered due to the personal nature of these scripts.

The phone referenced for the various adb and fastboot operations is the [Sony Xperia XA2](https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_xa2-8986.php). If you own this phone then some of the scripts _may_ be useful to you.
