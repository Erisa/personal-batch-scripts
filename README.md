# Personal Batch Scripts
This repository contains my personal batch (`.bat`) scripts used to automate aspects of my Windows 10 usage.  
These scripts are highly personalized and are not recommended to be used as-is on other peoples computers. The scripts are made public in the hopes that someone can either adapt them for themselves or learn from them.  
Most Pull Requests and Issues will not be considered due to the personal nature of these scripts.
